<h1>Moving Guide</h1>
<div class="page-line">
<h2 id="contractual-relationship">Man And Van Transportation Transformation</h2>
<p>Over the 5 years the Man and Van industry has trebled in size mainly due to the increased number of Vans on the road and the number of people moving home every year. This has lead to the largest increase in professionalism over any other industry in the UK. The increases mean that you can now get a highly rated removals service at exceptional Man and Van prices.</p>
<P>The Compare the Man and Van team come from a lifetime of experience within the Man and Van industry and are here to apply our experience taking the stress out of not only your move day but the often convoluted booking process as well.</P>
<P>As soon as you have entered your moves details in to our quick and simply quote form you will be seconds away from viewing multiple Man and Van quotes from service providers in your area and may we add at no extra cost to you.</P>

<h2 id="license">Why We Are Different Compared To Other Man And Van Operators</h2>
<p>The majority of the other man and van websites you can find on on-line all operate a certain number of man and vans on the road each day, so what happens is they will take all of the bookings they can without knowing if a man and van will be available for the date and time you have requested.</p>
<P>You book a van for a Saturday and the van doesn't arrive, so you call the number and are told that your van has been delayed on another job, which is of little help if your waiting outside with your belongings or you have an estate agent pacing the room wanting the keys from you. This happens all of the time with man and van operators and is very stressful for both the customer and controller which often leads to bad customer service.</P>
<P>Compare the man and van do not operate this way and 100% guarantee that if you book a man & van through our platform, that the service you book is available for the date / time you have selected and is reserved for you specifically. The text and email confirmations you receive will also contain all of your drivers contact details so you can contact the driver directly. In the event of delay you will be updated with regular estimated times of arrival because the driver is en route to you rather than stuck on another job.</P>
<P>Another advantage to booking with compare the man and van is all of our drivers take pride in the art of transporting items safely which maintains their high feedback ratings on our website. You will not be able to view feedback on each of the multi van operators drivers. It is important you check each companies reviews before you book or you could very easily have a bad day.</P>
<P>You can view compare the man and van's feedback on Feefo and the drivers feedback from inside their profiles on the quotes page. We have already over 100 man and van members active in London alone who are all are eager to build a reputation. This makes compare the man and van's pier to pier booking platform the key to a less stressful move day experience.</P>

<h2 id="license">Man and Van Services VS Van Hire</h2>
<p>Many people are not aware of the risks that come with Hire Vans when moving home and the advantages to hiring a local Man and Van service. The obvious expense with hiring a Van is the deposit you are required to pay which on average is £300.00. Then there is the excess you will be charged for the smallest of dents. Because the hire Van company would have requested your credit card details prior to driving the Van away there is nothing you can do to stop them charging your card between £500 - £1,000 which is charged as standard by Hire Van companies.</p>
<P>Then there are the equipment required to move your items safely i.e. trolley, straps, and blankets. You will not be provided with this equipment by the Hire Van company and they will let you drive away knowing there is every chance you have no experience in driving a heavy goods vehicle and that you have no experience in loading the vehicle safely. If you do not use straps and blankets when loading the Van it is very likely you will get to the first corner of your journey and hear a loud bang in the back of the Van. Not only will this make you jump but your possessions could be damaged and so may the Van internally depending on the weight of what is being moved . Now what seemed like a good cost effective idea has turned into an expensive nightmare. This is where using a professional Man and Van service provider can avoid all of the problems above.</P>
<P>Any professional Man and Van service provider will always have the equipment to transport your items safely. You will be asked to pay a small deposit by credit or debit card when booking to secure your van's availability for the day you are moving, you can then pay the remaining balance in cash to the driver at the end of your move and be issued with either a paper or electronic receipt. If you do not feel you need the driver's help to load and unload the Van, which is why you have considered Hiring a Van you can select a no help needed service which will reduce your prices and mean two passengers can travel in the Van at no extra charge.</P>
<P>On the whole we would always recommend a Man and Van service rather than a Hire Van company because you will save time and money and is a much less effort because you don't have to go to the garage to re-fuel the Van before returning it and then have to wait around for the Hire Van company to check the Van for damage. Then to finish off what can be a stressful day if you don't have anyone to take you home you will need to pay more money for public transport.</P>
<h2 id="license">Things to do before moving</h2>
<p>- Plan ahead, If you need storage / boxes always order in advance, this will mean you are prepared and ready to go for when your Man and Van arrives. We can get your first months storage free and will even deliver the boxes to your door before move day.</p>
<P>- Don't forget to tell your bank, credit card providers, insurance company, building society, TV licensing, DVLA and other websites you have joined that your home address details will be changing.</P>
<P>- Make sure you have all of the keys back from neighbours, friends and relatives before leaving the property and give them to your estate agent.</P>
<P>- Make a list of important phone numbers like your estate agents, your solicitor and Man and Van service provider.</P>
<P>- If you are moving to a completely new area be sure to tell your doctor, dentist and optician that you will be registering with new ones.</P>
<P>- Arrange for your utilities to be switched off before leaving your current property and reconnected in your new home.</P>
<P>- And finally contact your internet service provider so they can connect you in you new home.</P>
<h2 id="license">How To Save On Storage</h2>
<p>Compare the Man and Van are all about getting customers the best prices when moving home and this includes storage facility's. Where people tend to lose money when moving home is requesting storage with the service provider who is helping them move.</p>
<P>This is a mistake as you will be charged extra to have the service provider arrange what you could arrange on-line in minutes. Over the last few years you have probably noticed the many large storage facility's opening in your area the reason for this is because it's easy to book, cost effective and convenient if you are prepared to contact your local storage facility directly this will save you money.</P>
<P>As soon as you have confirmed your storage space return to Compare the Man And Van enter your details and compare live quotes with the option to book instantly. The driver will then either meet you at the storage facility or stop at the storage facility en route to your destination.</P>
<P>If you really don't want to arrange the storage yourself you can request a call back from a service provider from inside their driver profiles on the quotes page and they will be happy to discuss arranging storage for your items with you.</P>
<h2 id="license">How To Save On Packing Services</h2>
<p>Compare the Man and Van are all about helping customers get the best prices when moving and this includes Packing Services. Where people tend to lose money when moving is paying the service provider to provide the packaging.</p>
<P>This is a mistake as you will be charged extra to have the service provider buy and bring the packaging with them. If they purchase your packaging from a local storage facility you could be paying as much as £5.00 for a medium box which can get expensive especially when you combine the additional charge for the service provider to actually do the packing.</P>
<P>The answer to this problem is to buy on-line, if you still have 5 days+ before your move then you still have time to order your packaging which will save you money. The most popular place to order packaging is eBay as you by up to 25 New large boxes for as little £18.00 and can get even better deals on used boxes at auction.</P>
<P>As you have seen all of our quotes are Pay As You Go so our services providers will be more than happy to arrive and carefully pack your items for you.</P>
<p>If you would still like the service provider to provide your packing materials you can request a call back from the service provider from inside their driver profiles which can be found on the quotes page and they will be happy to call and discuss your packing requirements with you.</p>
<h2 id="license">Student Discounts</h2>
<p>Compare the Man and Van service providers love to help the next generations and often offer Student discounts. The services chosen discount percentage will be deducted from your on-line quotes providing you require the driver to help load and unload. If you have friends or family available who can assist with the loading and unloading you can book our customer loading service (no help from the driver) which will save you more than the drivers discount.</p>
<P>If you choose to book the customer loading service all of the vans equipment will be available for you to use and the driver will be happy to give advice when requested. We unfortunately cannot offer a customer loading + student discount combined as this would not make the move viable. We hope this has explained how Compare the Man and Van's services offer student discounts.</P>
<P>If not email your questions to info@comparethemanandvan.co.uk or call 020 3455 8696.</P>
<h2 id="license">Moving Internationally</h2>
<p>Moving internationally is often seen as a daunting task. Choosing a removals company that can work internationally depends on several factors, including the location you are moving to, the speed you want your goods to arrive, and the method of transportation you want for your goods. To determine the final price, contact several companies and receive quotes. Most businesses will provide information for both sea and air freight, allowing you to choose the method most suitable for you.</p>
<h2 id="license">Sea Freight</h2>
<p>Your belongings can be shipped through the sea in a full container load or groupage. A full container offers you an independent, safe and secure steel container. These containers differ in sizes, and you will be given a different price quote depending on the size and volume of the container, which varies from 2,400 to 850 cubic feet. This method prevents any third party from accessing your goods, as well as any accidental mix up with someone else's property.</p>
<p>On the other hand, groupage is a shared container that only ships when it is full, so you are unable to accurately predict its shipment date. However, groupage is more cost-effective compared to a full container load.</p>

<h2 id="license">Air Freight</h2>
<p>Although a rather expensive form of transportation of goods compared to sea freight, sending your goods through air does provide you with several advantages. For example, your goods will be shipped in a shorter period and can reach any desired destination inaccessible by sea.</p>
<p>Air freight charges are also determined on the basis of size and volume. The items are placed in the cargo section of the plane and are packaged in special containers before being flown.</p>

<h2 id="license">Within Europe</h2>
<p>You have several options for moving items within Europe. Either you can choose a company that will package your items for you, or you can choose to self-package. Companies will issue you a quote depending on your needs, so make sure to clearly state your requirements.</p>

<h2 id="license">Packing Services</h2>
<p>Most removal firms will give you the option of packing the items yourself, or requesting the removal firm to do the packing on your behalf. You can save money by packing on your own, but a packing service save you time and professionally pack your goods, avoiding any accidental damage. Below is a list of services commonly offered by packing services:</p>

<h2 id="license">Full Packing Service</h2>
<p>The removals company will pack everything for you with the full packing service. You can inform the company if you want certain items handled differently. Most services also include special packaging for fragile goods.</p>


<h2 id="license">Glass, China, and Ceramic</h2>
<p>Need help with just those tricky items that are easily breakable? You can find a company to pack those items specifically and save on costs. Make sure to check that the company you choose is trained to handle delicate crockery, such as china.</p>

<h2 id="license">Clothes</h2>
<p>Sometimes moving clothes can be a hassle, especially when you need them to stay fresh and free of creases. Ask the removals company if they have experience handling clothes. The company should be able move them while hanging or fold them, without damaging their shape.</p>



<h2 id="license">Other Items</h2>
<p>Heavy items, such as books, can also be packed separately for convenience. In addition, some companies may offer to package goods like utensils, which some customers might find hard to handle.</p>

<h2 id="license">Packing Material</h2>
<p>Packing materials are another major moving cost. No move is complete without boxes, bubble wrap, and tape. Most removal firms sell all types of packing materials to their customers. You can order moving packs and individual boxes online, or pick them up from a local store. Some materials you might need include:</p>
<p>- Strong and sturdy boxes of various sizes</p>
<p>- Tape or tape guns</p>
<p>- Tape or tape guns</p>
<p>- Rolls of bubble wrap</p>
<p>- Mattress protectors</p>
<p>- Bubble bags</p>
<p>- Plastic sofa covers</p>
<p>Make sure that the packing material is delivered on time to allow you to pack the items prior to the arrival of the removal firm.</p>

<h2 id="license">Requesting a Survey</h2>
<p>Requesting a survey is important and is often free of charge. It allows the removal company to assess the job before the moving day so they can come prepared. Be honest and clear with what you want moved. Point out any tight spots on your territory or specify hard to access items. The company should provide you a quote after the survey based on the volume of items. It is a good idea to dispose of or sell unnecessary items to significantly lower your volume and moving costs.</p>

<h2 id="license">Fixed Price vs. Hourly Rates</h2>
<p>Your Man and Van cost could be drastically lowered based on whether you choose a pay as you go service or a fixed price. Your personal situation will determine which rate is the most ideal. If you are confident that you can pack all of the items and that they are easily removable, then you may want to choose a pay as you go service to save money.</p>
<p>Most companies will provide you a fixed price quote with additional costs for other services included as a precaution. For example, a company may give you a quote that requires an additional hour to move your sofa due to its tight location. However, perhaps you have experience moving the sofa and you are certain that the location will not be a problem. In this case, you can request the removals firm to give you an hourly rate, since you know that the entire process needs less time than they expect.</p>
<p>Most removal firms with fixed rates maintain a "one placement" policy for each item once it arrives at its destination. This means that you cannot ask them to move it to a different position after it has been placed in its initial spot. In this case, you will likely prefer an hourly rate to provide the removal firm the time to properly arrange your items.</p>
<p>Although hourly rates are more flexible and convenient, budgeting them can be difficult since you will not know the final rate beforehand. If cost is an issue for you and you are uncertain that the hourly rate will match the fixed price, then you should consider the fixed price rate. Offices, companies, and business also prefer a fixed price rate for its advantage of a definite price quote.</p>

<h2 id="license">The Best Choice</h2>
<p>In the end, determining the best choice for a removals company depends on your personal needs and preferences. If you book a Compare the Man and Van service provider, your move will be comfortable and hassle-free.</p>
<p>Always keep a list of items with you before you send them, and label your boxes for easy handling. Demand clear answers from you Man and Van service provider. Verify the firm's credentials and experience by viewing the their driver profiles on the quotes page of our website. Make arrangements for pets or elderly so that they are not lost or hurt during the moving process. Most importantly, while you prepare for your moving day, make sure to relax and enjoy the process as much as possible.</p>
