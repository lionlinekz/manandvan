	<!-- Item 
						<dt>How do I get a delivery/removal quote?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Requesting quotes on AnyVan is easy. Simply post what you need to move, where it needs to go and when you need it done. This will then create a listing on our site.</p>
							<p>Listing items is completely free, and can be done in a matter of seconds. Feel free to list as many items as you wish and rest assured that you are under NO obligation to accept any of the quotes you receive from transport providers.</p>
							
						</dd>
						
						<dt>How can I receive more quotes?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>There are few ways in which you can increase the number of quotes you receive. Firstly, giving as much detail as possible about the item/s you are moving will provide transport providers with a clearer idea of whether they have the correct vehicle to complete the job. Entering details such as weight and dimensions, and an inventory for house moves, will all help you to receive more quotes</p>
							<p>Secondly, flexibility with dates will help increase the number of quotes you receive and potentially encourage cheaper prices, as transport providers may be able to pick up your item as part of a route they are already taking.</p>
							<p>Inviting companies to quote will also help increase the number of quotes you receive as you may make your listing more visible to appropriately matched transporters who hadn't previously seen it.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>When and who do I need to pay?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>To secure your chosen transport provider, you are required to pay a deposit to AnyVan. This payment is only taken after you've accepted a quote from a transport provider. The deposit can be paid through our Secure Payment Gateway (which accepts all major credit and debit cards) or via PayPal.</p>
					<p>We also accept card payments over the phone.</p>
							<p>After paying the initial deposit to AnyVan, you then pay the remaining balance directly to your chosen transport provider. Transport providers generally specify their accepted payment methods on their profiles; alternatively you can discuss this with them directly.</p>
                            <p>The amount you are quoted on AnyVan, is the total amount you pay for the job. There are no hidden extras. Transport providers' quotes are also all inclusive of all the services they offer.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>How do I receive quotes for the delivery of an eBay auction item?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>AnyVan is fully compatible with eBay and is also a member of the eBay developer's programme. </p>
							<p>To import an eBay auction item, simply enter the item number in the 'Enter What Needs Moving' field. We will then auto populate the related fields in the listing process (i.e. what the item is, its dimensions etc.)</p>
							<p>You can request quotes for eBay items you are bidding on, interested in or have already won. If you don't win the auction or no longer need the item transported, please be sure to remove the listing from the site to save transport providers' time, quoting on items which no longer need moving.</p>
						</dd>
						
						<dt>How do I change my email notifications?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>To manage the frequency of the notifications you receive, click on 'Edit My Profile' (located in the drop down which appears when you hover over your username on the top right of the page)</p>
							<p>You will then be taken to the 'Profile & Preferences' page where you can change the frequency of emails on the left hand side.</p>
							<p>You will always receive email notifications by default when:</p>
                            <p>You receive a message from a Transport Provider</p>
                            <p>You accept a bid You also have the option of being sent an email notification:</p>
                            <p>When a new bid is received on one of your deliveries</p>
                            <p>When a bid is withdrawn on one of your deliveries</p>
                            <p>When your delivery listing is about to expire</p>
                            <p>The notifications are in place for your convenience so the more notifications you receive, the better understanding you'll have of all activity.</p>
                         
						</dd>
                        <dt>How can I be sure my items arrive in the same condition?</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>If you are packing your own items be sure that you wrap them well in order to prevent any chance of them getting damaged.</p>
							<p>We provide both check-in and checkout documents to be used by both customers and transport providers. This is a document that both parties sign on collection of the items and again on delivery. It is not compulsory that you use this document, however, it is recommended to help protect all parties in the unlikely event of any dispute relating to the condition of items.</p>
							<p>These documents can be found attached to your job-sheet or Driver Details document. This also contains all the details you need to communicate with the transport company in question.</p>
