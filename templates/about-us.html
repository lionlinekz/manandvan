<h2 id="headding-center our_philosophy" class="margin-bottom"> Our Philosophy </h2>
<p>Let's face it, moving can be difficult. Whether you're packing to move to a new home or trying to pick up a sofa you've bought on a classifieds site, organising a delivery can be time consuming and expensive. You just want someone to help you through it.</p>

<p>That's why we're here. We've spent the past 5 years building a community of over 35,000 trusted transport providers and growing our team of Customer Service Heroes, so we can get you the cheapest quote with minimum hassle.</p>

<p>How do we do it? We follow the AnyVan way of thinking:</p>

<p>Lugg may amend the Terms related to the Services from time to time. Amendments will be effective upon Lugg's posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service. Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.</p>
<h2 id="the-services">1. Keep it simple</h2>
<p><em>"Make it Simple, But Significant" ~ Don Draper</em></p>

<p>We're here to make the process of finding cheap delivery quotes as quick and easy as possible for our customers. That's why we've adopted a clean, minimalistic, step-by-step design in our online process, so you can focus on what you're here for â€“ getting the best quote.</p>

<h2 id="the-services">2. Friendliness is next to godliness</h2>
<p><em>"Nothing is so contagious as enthusiasm." ~Samuel Taylor Coleridge</em></p>
<p>Although we are an online business, we understand how frustrating it is when you can't speak to a real person. That's why we have a team of energetic and motivated Customer Service Heroes on hand waiting to help you. They're available to chat from 8:00am - 10:00pm Monday to Friday, 9:00am - 5:00pm Saturdays & 10:00am - 6:00pm on Sundays. You can contact us on 020 3005 6000.</p>
<h2 id="the-services">3. Work hard, play hard</h2>
<p><em>"It always seems impossible until it is done" ~ Nelson Mandela</em></p>
<p>At AnyVan, we work on the premise that one person alone cannot make the company, it needs to be a team effort. Our motivated attitude toward the work we do is facilitated by AnyVan's open door policy, encouraging honest communication across all levels of the business. We love having a laugh, our office is always buzzing, and on a Friday evening you can find us sharing a few drinks playing a friendly game of AnyVan Ping Pong.</p>

<div class="Page-body" id="our_mission">
<h2 id="headding-center" class="margin-bottom">Our Mission</h2>
<p>AnyVan was created to solve the major problems of the removals industry, specifically in regard to the quoting process, the high price of quotes, and the amount of CO2 produced.</p>
<p>How are we solving these problems?</p>

<h2 id="the-services">1. Making moving easier</h2>
<p>We are continually expanding our network of trusted transport providers to empower our customers with choice. We want to be sure that you find the best delivery quote, whatever your situation might be.</p>

<h2 id="the-services">2. Providing the highest level of customer service</h2>
<p>AnyVan is focused on creating a fantastic customer experience, both online and offline. Currently sitting at first place in Trustpilot's Removals category, the AnyVan team is working hard to reach a 10/10 rating.</p>

<h2 id="the-services">3. Reducing CO2 emissions</h2>
<p>The transport industry accounts for between 20% and 25% of world energy consumption. We're encouraging collaborative consumption and saving up to 1 million kilos of CO2 per month by filling unused space in vans and lorries</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on our customer service, and you can rely on us to always be positive, responsive, friendly and reliable. It''s the AnyVan way!</p>
